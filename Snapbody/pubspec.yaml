  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
fonts:
  - family: Pretendard
    fonts:
      - asset: assets/font/Pretendard/Pretendard-ExtraLight.otf
        weight: 200
      - asset: assets/font/Pretendard/Pretendard-Light.otf
        weight: 300
      - asset: assets/font/Pretendard/Pretendard-Regular.otf
        weight: 400
      - asset: assets/font/Pretendard/Pretendard-Medium.otf
        weight: 500
      - asset: assets/font/Pretendard/Pretendard-SemiBold.otf
        weight: 600
      - asset: assets/font/Pretendard/Pretendard-Bold.otf
        weight: 700
      - asset: assets/font/Pretendard/Pretendard-Black.otf
        weight: 900
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,

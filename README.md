# Build-Your-Own-World
This is my attempt at BYOW project, a video game platform consisting of randomly generated worlds. This is a 2D tile-based world exploration engine.
In this world, the user is able to explore by walking around and interacting with objects. This game is similar to that of the game 'Zelda II' or 'Pacman'

The requirements for this projects were:
- used the mouse arrow to hover over objects and identify it
- create randonly generated rooms, hallways, and a door
- user should have the ability to navigate the world using WASD keys 

The goal of this game is to:
- obtain all the 'items' displayed on the randomly generated map
- whilst doing so, do not bump into 'enemies', else you will lose your life. 

Tech: Java, IntellJ, StdDraw

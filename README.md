# Food-Safety-Analysis
This is a project investigating food safety scores for restaurants in San Francisco. 

Throughout this project, I have cleaned and explored data using Pandas as my main tech stack
From this, I have gained practice with: 

- Reading simple csv files
- Working with data at different levels of granularity
- Identifying the type of data collected, missing values, anomalies, etc.
- Exploring characteristics and distributions of individual variables

This is a project that I have completed for the course Data 100 at UC Berkeley Spring 2019

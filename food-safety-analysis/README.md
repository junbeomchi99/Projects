# Food-Safety-Analysis
This is a project investigating food safety scores for restaurants in San Francisco. 

Throughout this project, I have cleaned and explored data using Pandas as my main tech stack
From this, I have gained practice with: 

- Reading simple csv files
- Working with data at different levels of granularity
- Identifying the type of data collected, missing values, anomalies, etc.
- Exploring characteristics and distributions of individual variables

The San Francisco Department of Public Health provides restaurants in SF using Food Safety Score Cards.
Throughout this project, I have performed EDA to understand how the food safety score is calculated. 
Using Pandas, I have cleaned and explored the food safety data and created visualization that would help me analyze the data further. 
Some interesting observations were analyzing the distribution of inspection and violation scores, identifying missing Zip Code values, and analyzing restaurant ratings over time.

By exploring this data, insight toward working with data at different levels of granularity, exploring characteristics and distributions of individual variables, and applying probability sampling techniques was acquired.


TECH STACK: Python, Pandas, Matlib

This is a project that I have completed for the course Data 100 at UC Berkeley Spring 2019

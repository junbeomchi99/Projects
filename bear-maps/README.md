# BearMaps
This is my attempt at BearMaps, which mimicks Google Maps and contains features such as zooming in/out, shortest-route findings, etc.

Explored and/or Implemented:
- A* algorithm for shortest route finding
- minPQ, K-d Tree
- Map Rastering (API)
- ETC.

Could further develop on:
- Autocomplete and Search
- Turn by Turn Navigation (giving directions to the user w/ the shortest route)
- publish on web for use/display

    "In question 4a, we counted the number of null values per ZIP code. Reminder: we still only use the zip codes found in `sf_dense_zip`. Let's now count the proportion of null values of longitudinal coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new dataframe of counts of the null and proportion of null values, storing the result in `fraction_missing_df`. It should have an index called `postal_code_5` and should also have 3 columns:\n",

    "1. `count null`: The number of missing values for the zip code.\n",
    "2. `count non null`: The number of present values for the zip code.\n",

If a `business_id` in `ins` does not exist in `bus`, the name and address should be given as NaN.\n",

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",

We expect someone of a left-skewed graph or bars much higher/concentrated on the right side (postive x-axis). However, we see that the data seem to be centered/ its mode is at x=0 and the bars are almost normally distributed.
